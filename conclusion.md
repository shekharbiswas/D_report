# 6. Conclusion

This study replicates and extends the findings of Bathke (2009) by simulating and comparing the performance of three prominent nonparametric trend tests under various design conditions.

## Summary of Findings

- **Accuracy Under Null Hypothesis**: All tests maintain Type I error rates close to the nominal level, confirming their statistical validity.
- **Power Under Alternatives**: The tests demonstrate high power for detecting monotonic trends, especially as sample size increases or group structure becomes more distinct.
- **Test Agreement**: Across both independent and dependent sample structures, the unified test statistic ν̂ closely matches — and often outperforms — traditional methods such as T_HN and T_JT.
- **Balanced and Unbalanced Designs**: Results are consistent across balanced and unbalanced group settings, showcasing the reliability of these methods in practical scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

Nonparametric trend testing offers a powerful, assumption-light alternative for analyzing ordered group effects. The unified approach introduced by Bathke allows for a consistent framework that accommodates both independent and dependent sample structures, simplifying implementation and interpretation.

Researchers and practitioners in biostatistics, psychology, and social sciences — where ordinal and non-normal data are common — will find these methods particularly valuable.
